AJAX-jQuery-Login-Plugin
========================
I have developed this Login plugin and please see below for its checkpoints:

1.) I have used a sample API storing JSON data for AJAX call. API is located at http://www.json-generator.com/j/bZSMfjwbyq?indent=4

2.) For successful case, please enter username as admin and password as admin or any value from API

3.) To create different instances of plugin, just add any div with class component in index.html
